# Minority
Interactive HTML demo exploring how broad labels like ‘minority’ distort outcomes and reinforce bias in AI/ML datasets.
This demo was created using my fundamental coding skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with collaborative support from Copilot. I believe in transparency: AI tools can accelerate learning and development, but the responsibility for clarity, accuracy, and ethical framing remains with the developer. By merging my foundational skills with AI collaboration, this project demonstrates how coding can be both technically rigorous and ethically intentional.
